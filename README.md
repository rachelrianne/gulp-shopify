# RR Shopify Starter Theme 

Version: 1.0

## Author

Rachel Bain

## Credits

This starter theme is based off of:  
- [Shopify Slate v.0.14.0](https://shopify.github.io/slate.shopify.com/docs/0.14.0/) scaffolding, esp CSS & JS
- [Shopify Skeleton Theme](https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme "Shopify Skeleton Theme GitHub page")
- [Gulp + Shopify by Jase Warner](https://jase.io/gulp-shopify)
- Too many years of doing this

## New Theme Stuff

- Go to the `dev` directory and run `npm install` 
- Set up `config.yml`

## Every Day Stuff

- Run `gulp watch` from the `dev` directory for SCSS, JS, images, and fonts, which will then be moved to the `assets` directory.
- Run `themekit watch` from the root directory.

## Other Notes

- [StyleLint Docs](https://stylelint.io/user-guide)
- From Gulp + Shopify README: "You may also write your JavaScript in ES6 &ndash; The Gulp scripts task uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/ "Babel website"), so you can use the latest syntax without worrying about browser support."
- In Terminal `cd` into the `dev` directory and install the Gulp packages (if you haven’t already installed Gulp, you’ll need to [do so](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md "Gulp installation") first):
